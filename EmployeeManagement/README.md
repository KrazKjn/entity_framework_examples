# Employee Manager Solution

The Employee Manager Solution is a full-stack application designed to manage employees and departments efficiently. It combines a powerful backend service with a responsive frontend interface to provide a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Employee Management**: Add, update, delete, and view employee details.
- **Department Management**: Perform CRUD operations for departments.
- **Responsive UI**: Intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing entities.
- **Data Integrity**: Backend validation ensures consistency in the database.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **.NET with Entity Framework**: Handles database operations using an object-relational mapper (ORM) for seamless interaction with the database.
- **RESTful API**: Exposes endpoints for CRUD operations on employees and departments.

### Frontend
- **React**: Provides a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Axios**: Used to handle API calls from the frontend to the backend.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Backend Service**:
    - Entity Framework is used to interact with the database, handling operations for the `Employee` and `Department` entities.
    - RESTful API endpoints are implemented to perform CRUD operations.

2. **Frontend Client**:
    - The React-based frontend communicates with the backend API.
    - React components display employee and department data, allowing users to interact with it.
    - Features include data fetching, real-time updates, and error handling.

## How to Run

1. **Backend Setup**:
   - Clone the repository.
   - Navigate to the backend project folder.
   - Restore dependencies using `dotnet restore`.
   - Run database migrations using `dotnet ef database update`.
   - Start the backend service using `dotnet run`.

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the React project folder.
   - Install dependencies using `npm install`.
   - Start the development server using `npm start`.

3. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (for the frontend).
